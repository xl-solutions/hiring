```

### Virtual environment

It is also possible to execute this project using [virtual development environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

### Database

Required has the most updated version of [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/). Change the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` variable in the `settings.toml` configuration file

```toml
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://docker:xlsolution@database/xlsolution'
```

### Installation of Dependencies

Run the command to perform the dependency installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Flask Env

It is necessary to configure the flask environment variables with the values `FLASK_ENV='development'` e `FLASK_APP=app/app.py`


## :gear: Running the Application

If the application is run by the docker, simply run the `docker-compose up` command and then access the application via the address
[http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)

If the application was executed locally with a virtual environment. Run the command below after installing the dependencies
