# Background

A new client hired XL Solutions and asked to make an application to search for github repositories by username and also the issues from a repository. For this functionality, the application must use the github API.

# Requisites

1. The application will initially show a page where the user will type the username of a github user.
2. The page will have to show the name of the user, the avatar, and also the list of repos. In the list of the repos, the page will have to show the `name of the repo`, `the link to clone the repo` and a `link` to show the repository on the github page.
3. By clicking on the repo name, the user will be redirected to other page, that will show the `issues` lists of the repo.
4. By clicking at the title of the `issue` on the page, the user will be redirected to other page that will show the title of the issue, and also the body of the issue, that will contain the description of the problem.

# Observações:
